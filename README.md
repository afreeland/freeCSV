freeCSV
=======

Fast client side CSV parsing tool for reading files


##What does it do?
freeCSV allows a user to upload a CSV file and parse it client side.  This means a user can view/iterate through a CSV file before ever uploading it to a server.

*Currently only supports header if it is on first row*


##What was it created for?
freeCSV was created so that a user can see their CSV data and map it appropriately.  All of this happening in real-time with their file data and no server req/res needed.


##What else is coming?
freeCSV will also be supporting row by row support...meaning you may request a row line from the parser and it will return back the record for that row.
